This can be used in conjunction with this book to help you determine how much deeper you'll need to go. Additionally, when right-clicked above se-level the prospector's pick will inform you if there's a deposit in your general vicinity, and if so, where. Once you're underground, it'll scan a configurable area (5x5x5 by default) in the direction you're looking and tell you what you might find."
